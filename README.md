<p>Learned how to code while using the CodeWars platform, where you can clearly see
my progress in my solutions.</p>
<p>Managed to reach <b>2Kyu</b> in just under 5 months but due to university responsibilities I had
to slow down a bit.</p>
<p>Reached <b>1Kyu</b> in about ~10 months</p>
<p>My main goal is to reach 1 Dan (Master) level in python which will definitely take some time but
I will make it there eventually.</p>

Apologies in advance for some naive solutions, many of them need to be refined since
I got better at coding. :)
